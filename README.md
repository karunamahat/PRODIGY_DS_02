TASK 02:
Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Solution:
This repository demonstrates the process of cleaning data using SQL queries, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), and visualizing the results using Power BI. The dataset used for this analysis is [train.csv](main/train.csv) .

## Data Cleaning in SSMS
The raw data was initially imported from csv file for data cleaning to SSMS. The data cleaning process involved tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and correcting inconsistencies.

## EDA with SQL in SSMS
After cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed using SQL queries in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The SQL script [TASK02.sql](main/TASK02.sql)  contains queries used to analyze various aspects of the dataset, such as summary statistics, distributions, correlations, and trends.

## Visualization with Power BI
The results of the exploratory data analysis performed in SSMS were visualized using Power BI. The Power BI Desktop file [TASK02.pbix](main/TASK02.pbix)  contains interactive visualizations, including charts and graphs to effectively communicate insights derived from the data analysis.
